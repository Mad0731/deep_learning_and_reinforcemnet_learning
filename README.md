# deep_learning_and_reinforcemnet_learning
The objective of using deep learning is to generate design paparmeters according to the objective EM response. Hence, foward network training is done to predict the spectrum according to the design geometries features. 
Once the training is done minimizing MSE adn with out overfitting or underfitting, weights and biases of th enetwork is saved. Hereafter, these weights and biases can be used to predict the specrum accdoring to your geomtries input features.
