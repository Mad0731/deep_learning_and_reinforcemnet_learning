# deep_learning_and_reinforcemnet_learning
The objective of using deep learning is to generate design paarmeters according to the objective EM response. Hence, foward network training is done to predict the spectrum according to the design geometries features. 
Once the training is done by minimizing MSE and with out overfitting or underfitting, weights and biases of the network is saved. Hereafter, these weights and biases can be used to predict the specrum accdoring to your geomtries input features.
This process is similar to the commercially available EM solver but trained network is speed and time saving method when it comes to the optimization.
